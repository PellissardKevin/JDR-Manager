                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

Copyright (C) 2025 Pellissard Kevin
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                          Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.  The licenses for most software
are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it.  By
contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee
your freedom to share and change free software—to make sure the
software is free for all its users.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price. To understand the concept, you should think of “free” as in
“free speech,” not as in “free beer”.  Freedom is essential to the
enjoyment of the software, and the GPL ensures that freedom is
protected.

The GPL, version 3, is designed to be a free software license for
the 21st century, addressing many concerns that have arisen since
the original version of the GPL was written in 1989.

                         TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Definitions.

  “This License” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

  “Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds
  of works, such as semiconductor masks.

  “The Program” refers to any work that is covered by this License.
  Each licensee is addressed as “you”.

  “License” refers to the terms and conditions for copying, distributing,
  and/or modifying the work.

  “The source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work for
  making modifications to it.  “Object code” means any non-source form of
  a work.

  “You” refers to the licensee, i.e., the person who accepts the terms
  of this license.

  1. Source Code.

  You must provide a copy of the source code for the work you are
  distributing.  This can be done by including it with the software
  distribution or by providing an easy way for users to obtain it.

  2. Modifications.

  You may modify the Program or any part of it, and you may distribute
  your modifications under the terms of this License. You must also
  document the changes you make to the program.

  3. Copyleft.

  You must keep the GPL license intact when you distribute the software,
  and you must include the same terms and conditions with any copies or
  derivative works. Any modified versions of the Program must also be
  licensed under the GPL.

  4. Distribution of License.

  You may distribute copies of the Program or its modified versions
  under the terms of this license. When you distribute a copy, you must
  provide the same license for the recipients of the copy.

  5. No Warranty.

  The program is provided “as-is”, without any warranties. If you choose
  to use the Program, you do so at your own risk.

  6. Patent Grant.

  When you distribute the Program, you grant a license to the recipients
  under any patents you own or control that are necessary to use, modify,
  or distribute the Program.

  7. Tivoization and DRM.

  You may not impose technical restrictions (e.g., digital rights
  management (DRM) or tivoization) that restrict the freedom of others
  to use the Program.

  8. Relicensing.

  You may relicense the Program under different terms, but you must not
  remove the GPL license or any provisions that apply to modifications.

  9. Miscellaneous.

  This License is designed to be compatible with other open-source
  licenses, and to promote and protect the freedom of software users.
  It applies worldwide.
